quick start:
----------------------- 
open instance.conf and global.conf and work through all lines containing " #<-CHANGEME".
Those are the ones that you probably have to change to get a working installation.

Other things to know: unlike IL2 SC sturmonanny will never start il2server.exe. 
This is a thing for you to do, or your hyperlobby client. Sturmonanny will patiently 
wait for a server to connect to, even if it ist started early.
